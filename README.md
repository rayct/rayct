"Math is the study of anything that obeys the rules of logic, using the rules of logic.

― Eugenia Cheng"


"You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing everything with logic. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass."

  ― Bruce Lee
